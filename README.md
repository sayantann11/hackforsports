## Description of project:

Cricket is one of the most loved sports of the country and Indian Premier league is
one of the flagship sports leagues of India, garnering wide attention every year.
Every year the sports league is garnering more attention than before.
This project is an attempt to analyze the performance of the players and the teams in
the Indian premier league and understand the capabilities of various players.
We will be mixing the cricket and the analytical world so that a non technical person can
also understand the performance of each team and player in a particular match.
We are trying to build an interactive platform using analytical application to give online
cricket platform an edge

## Proposed Solution:


The Indian Premier League is conducted every year and the participating teams represent a city in India. This is a
professional Twenty-twenty cricket league that is governed by the Board of Control of Cricket in India (BCCI).
Various factors affect the game like the skills of the players (like bowling rate, batting rate), their form, the rules
of the game and etcetera. Information visualization is a process of visualizing the information in such a way that
the information presented is accurate and easy to understand.
Bar charts help in representing the categorical data using rectangular bars. They are used to compare the items
between different groups over time. Pie charts are graphs that represent the data in the circular graph, the slices of
pie show the relative size of the data. Pie chart is said to be the pictorial representation of data. Box plot is a
measure of how well distributed the data is in a data set. It divides the data set into three quartiles and represents
the minimum, maximum and median, first quartile and third quartile in the data set.
This project tries to visualize these important factors that determine the playerâ€™s real position in the team using the
visualizing techniques and above mentioned visualization charts

### This repository contains the source code of the project work from past 24 hours.
The Jupyter Notebook contains:

1.To visualize the data set to maximum extent

2.To learn the development of a dashboard using the html, css, javascript

3.To apply various visualizing techniques learnt in class

4. To use the django framework in the pycharm IDE

5. To analyze the players performance and win the match strategically.
